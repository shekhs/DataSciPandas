Hierarchical Indexing
Description
You are provided with the dataset of a company which has offices across three cities - Mumbai, Bangalore and New Delhi. The dataset contains the rating (out of 5) of all the employees from different departments (Finance, HR, Marketing and Sales). 



Create a hierarchical index based on two columns: Office and Department



Print the first 5 rows as the output. Refer to the image below for your reference.







Note: You should not sort or modify values in other columns of the dataframe. Use sort_index(inplace=True) to club the same locations together.
